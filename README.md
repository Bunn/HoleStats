# Pi Stats

Follow up and manage the status of your [Pi-hole(s)](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole) with this simple macOS app that lives in your menu bar.

## Authentication Token
In order to use the "enable/disable" button you need to add your Authentication Token in the Settings screen.

There are two different ways to get your authentication token:

- /etc/pihole/setupVars.conf under WEBPASSWORD
- WebUI -> Settings -> API -> Show API Token

## Requirement
This project uses SwiftUI which requires macOS Catalina.

Tested with Pi-hole 4.4 and 5.0

## Mobile
If you want to run Pi Stats on your iPhone or iPad you can download [Pi Stats for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1523024268) which is [100% open source](https://github.com/Bunn/PiStatsMobile) as well :)

## Download
Pi Stats (and [SwiftHole](https://github.com/Bunn/SwiftHole)) is a free and open source hobby project of mine. If you want to support its development you can either pay whatever you want on [Gumroad](https://gum.co/iqhwv) or buy it on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pi-stats/id1514075262?ls=1) for those nice automatic updates :)
